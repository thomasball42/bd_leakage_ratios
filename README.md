For this to work, you need some data which is not present in this repo.

You will need to download and run this repository: https://github.com/louis-de-neve/mrio_pipeline. Do so for all years that you wish to run the leakage method for. 

You will need to change 'RPATH' in the run_countries.py file to the location of the MRIO output data.
