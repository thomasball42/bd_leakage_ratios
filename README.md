For this program to work, you need some data which is not present in this repo.

In a file called "data", you need **country_bd_items_weight.csv** and **country_codes.csv**. You also need to download **Production_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).csv** which can be found by downloading 'All Data Normalized' from [here](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL).

In addition, you need some (if not all) of the output files from the [Food_v0](https://github.com/thomasball42/food_v0) repository.
